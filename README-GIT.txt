CLONING THE REPOSITORY
======================
Anonymous cloning may be done from:

    git://git.zendframework.com/zf2test.git

If you have commit rights, you will use the following:

    ssh://git@git.zendframework.com:21652/zf2test.git

You must make sure your author email is specified exactly as it appears
in JIRA.  To do so, do the following in your git repository:

    git config user.email <your email address>

If it does not match, any commits made with you as an author will be
rejected.

If you are unsure of what email address is tied to your JIRA account,
visit the following site:

    http://framework.zend.com/crowd

and log in with your JIRA credentials. Click the "My Profile" link in
the upper right corner of the page. You will then see your email address
listed.

FEEDS AND EMAILS
================
RSS feeds may be found at:

    http://git.zendframework.com/feeds/<branch>.xml

where <branch> is a branch in the repository.

To subscribe to git email notifications, send an email to:

    zf-git-subscribe@lists.zend.com

You will need to reply to the verification email sent to you by this
list.

Should you wish to filter emails from the list, they will use the
"subject" line of commit messages, preceded by "[branch] ", and come
from "zf-git@lists.zend.com"

CONTRIBUTORS AND COMMITTERS
===========================
For the immediate future, and until we create a community process team,
only the Zend team will be committers. If you have a patch or
feature-set you wish to have incorporated into the repository, please
issue a pull request to a committer. A pull request may be done by using
git's "git-send-email" functionality, or by sending a request to a
committer indicating the URL of your repository, the branch that should
be pulled, and/or the specific revision(s) to pull.

If you are a contributor, and accept changes from a non-CLA'd developer,
you need to do the following:

 * Verify that the developer is granting you permission to commit the
   code to Zend Framework. If possible, get this permission in writing.

 * If you do not get verification, do not incorporate the code in your
   own branches.

 * Once you have merged the code into your branches, you need to commit
   it using the "-s" or "--signoff" switch to "git commit". The ZF
   pre-receive hook rejects any commits from non-CLA'd authors unless
   there is a sign-off message in the commit.
