            Zend\Http is one of the primary foundational components of Zend Framework.  Since much of what PHP does is
            web, specifically HTTP, it makes sense to have a performant, extensible, concise and consistent API to do
            all things HTTP.  In nutshell, there are several parts of Zend\Http:

        <para>
            The Request, Response and Headers portion of component Zend\Http component provides a fluent object oriented
            interface for introspecting information from all the various parts of an http request or http response.  The
            two main objects are 'Zend\Http\Request' and 'Zend\Http\Response'.  These two classes are "context-less",
            meaning, that they model a request or response in the same way whether it is presented by a client (to
            <emphasis>send</emphasis> a request and <emphasis>receive</emphasis> a response) or by a server (to
            <emphasis>receive</emphasis> a request and <emphasis>send</emphasis> a response).  In other words,
            regardless of the context, the API remains the same for introspecting their various respective parts. Each
            attempt to fully model a request or response so that a developer can create these objects from a factory, or
            they can be created and populated by hand.
